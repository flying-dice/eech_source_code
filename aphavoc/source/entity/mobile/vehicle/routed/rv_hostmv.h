/*
 * Host-owned movement of alive routed vehicles, ships, infantry and fixed-wing aircraft.  The host
 * keeps the authoritative position, speed and orientation of an alive mobile,
 * keyed by its host identity, and performs the physical step.  Campaign code keeps the
 * route, formation, hold and engage policy: it decides whether to move, stop
 * or sample terrain, and supplies the guide's desired speed, the vehicle's
 * acceleration limit and the waypoint position.  No EECH pointer crosses this
 * boundary.
 *
 * The campaign entity keeps a copy of the pose for the systems that read it
 * (combat, perception, arrival, Tacview).  On MOVE and STOP that copy is sent
 * only so the host can refuse a divergence; the host never adopts it.  PLACE
 * is an explicit campaign placement (a position, velocity or attitude setter
 * called by campaign or network code): the host adopts the pose it carries.
 *
 * Terrain stays campaign-side (a later stage): the sampled elevation, forest
 * flag and face normal at the pre-move position are inputs, as are the map
 * bounds.
